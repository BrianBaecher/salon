# salon

Uses a sh file to insert data into the salon database with customer information and appointment details.

It'd be a good idea to come back and revisit this project to come up with a more elegant solution. I listed a nearly identical function five times in the switch case and only changed the "service" variable within each one. Resulting in an unnecessarily long and redundant script.
