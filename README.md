# salon

Uses a sh file to insert data into the salon database with customer information and appointment details.

I got stuck on the last check in coderoad's list -- having to do with the message received when an appointment is successfully inserted. The output seemed identical and yet the test wouldn't pass. I refreshed the window ran it again and it passed somehow. I'm not sure if it would pass again.

It'd be a good idea to come back and revisit this project to come up with a more elegant solution. I listed a nearly identical function five times in the switch case and only changed the "service" variable within each one. Resulting in an unnecessarily long and hard-to-read script.
